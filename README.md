The picture below shows the “SENSE” Ribbon as well as the features that make up Sense Excel.

![Toolbar](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar.PNG)

### 6.1 "Connection"

The "Connection" portion of the "Sense" ribbon allows you to create and manage the connections Sense Excel makes to your Qlik Sense environment(s).  Once a connection is configured, use the Sign In and Sign Out buttons as described below.

a. Sign In : Pressing the sign in button will attempt to connect to the Connection shown in the drop down box.
b. Sign Out: This will end your active connection to the server. 

There are two different Connection creation techniques available, a manual process as well as a step-by-step Installation Wizard:

#### 6.1.1 Manual Connection Creation

1. Press the "..." next to the drop down box.
2. Press the New Connection button
3. Fill in the form with the appropriate values.

a. "Connection Name" field.  Enter a unique name for the connection 

BEST PRACTICE: Choose a Connection name that will be easy to identify in a drop down list. 

b. Ignore Certifate Errors Checkbox. 

Sometimes Qlik Sense is running on a server without a valid secuirty certificate.  Checking this box will ignore https://certificate errors are that are encountered and proceed with the connection.  Uncheking the box will allow the https:// chain to remain intact and provides the most security. The default setting is "checked".

![Connection Edit Property Panel Ignore Certificate Errors](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Connection-Edit-Property-Panel-Ignore-Certificate-Errors.png)

c. Connection Type

Depending on your Qlik Sense authorization strategy and which browser you are using, this parameter can be set to allow Sense Excel to work in any environment.  

![Connection Edit Property Panel Connection Type](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Connection-Edit-Property-Panel-Connection-Type.png)

There are 4 different Connection types available:

a. "Qlik Sense Desktop".  This setting in included in the default Sense Excel installation and points to the local machine using 127.0.0.1 as the ip address.

If do not use Qlik Sense Desktop as a data source this connection can be deleted.  It can be re-created at a later point by creating a new connection using the following parameters:  Type: Qlik Sense Desktop and Url ws://127.0.0.1:4848.

b. "Sense Server - Current Windows User"

Like Qlik Sense, the default behavior of Sense Excel uses Windows authentication and passes the credentials of current user to Qlik Sense.  This works with Qlik Sense Server implementations on a local machine as well as when Active Directory is used for single sign-on.

c. "Sense Server - Enter username/password"

This approach is used when you have different credentials for Qlik Sense than your local windows machine.  Signing in using this approach will prompt for Qlik Sense credentials.

d. "Sense Server - Custom authentication (via embedded Browser)"

This technique will open a new browser window, prompt for credentials and pass them to Qlik Sense via a session cookie to log into Qlik Sense. Use this approach when logging into a server on different domain or using a third party single sign on system such as OKTA.

5. "Url" 

Enter the url of your target server. https://your.qlikserver.com.  You can copy this from a the address bar of a browser used to connect to your Qlik Sense environment. Do not include /hub in this address.

6. 3rd Party Sigle Sign On

If using OKTA or similar, choose "Sense Server - Custom authentication (via embedded Browser)" as your "Type" and append your url as follows:  https://your.qlikserver.com/okta

7. "Session cookie header name" - Alternate Proxy Server

Sense Excel supports defining connections that point to different virtual proxy servers in a distributed Qlik Sense environment.  

A virtual proxy name that begins with -qlik can be used by appending the name of the virtual proxy directly to the url as follows: 

https://your.qlikserver.com/development

If your virtual proxy has a header name that begins with anything other than "-qlik" enter it in the "Session cookie header name" field like follows: "-otherheader"

![Connection](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Connection.png)

8. Save your connetion by pressing the Green Check Box.
 

#### 6.1.2 Create a Connection Using a Wizard

You can use use a step by step Wizard process to create a connection by following the steps below.

In the "SENSE" ribbon, use the Connections dropdown box and select "Create new connection to server" at the bottom of the list.
 
 ![Connection Edit New Connection Property Panel Wizard](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Connection-New-Connection-Property-Panel-Wizard.png)
 
 This will open the wizard process in the Sense Excel Propery Panel on the right side of your screen and prompt you for the necessary value with instructions.
 
1. Connection Name:  

Please enter a unique name for the connection you would like to create.  

BEST PRACTICE: Choose a Connection name that will be easy to identify in a drop down list. 
  
![Connection Edit New Connection Property Panel Wizard Step 1 Connection Name](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Connection-New-Connection-Property-Panel-Wizard-Step-1-Connection-Name.png)

2. Enter Url.  Type this entry in or copy if from the address bar of a browser connected to Qlik Sense.
    
  ![Connection Edit New Connection Property Panel Wizard Step 2 Connection Url](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Connection-New-Connection-Property-Panel-Wizard-Step-2-Connection-Url.png)
  
Hitting the "Next" button will attempt to authenticate using default Windows authentication with the credentials of the current user.  If this approach is supported you will see the "Success" messsage.   
  
3. If your current Windows credentials do not connect you will be prompted for Step 3.  The underlying Connection type will be changed to "Sense Server - Custom authentication (via embedded Browser)" and prompt your for the appropriate crentials.

![Connection Edit New Connection Property Panel Wizard Step 3 Custom Authentication](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Connection-New-Connection-Property-Panel-Wizard-Step-3-Custom-Authentication.png)

Upon successful connection to the Qlik server you will see the message below:

![Connection Edit New Connection Property Panel Wizard Step 4 Success](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Connection-New-Connection-Property-Panel-Wizard-Step-4-Success.png)

If your Connection attempt is unsuccessful, you will need to begin the Wizard process again with different parameter values.  Check that your url is correct as well with your Qlik administrator for any settings such as virtual proxies or headers that have been customized in your environment.

To exit the Sense Excel Propery Panel press the grey "X" at the top right of the window.


#### 6.1.1 Edit An Existing Connection

 ![Open Hub](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Open-Hub.png)

This button allows you to choose your a Qlik Sense App and access the dimensions, measures and underlying object data associated with it.  By default, a single workbook is associated with a single Qlik Sense App.  Just like within Qlik Sensee itself, all bookmarks, filter selections etc. will apply and act upon all Qlik Sense related data within the workbook. 

It is possible to cause specific data elements to not respond to filters/bookmark selections. Utilizing an Altered State or formulas within a column definition or SenseEV() you can specify a different behavior or source App.  These topics will be covered later in document.

 ![Open Hub Dialogue](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Open-Hub-Dialogue.png)

### 6.3 “Load data” and “Data Load Editor”

 ![Load Data](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Load-Data.png)
 
Sense Excel provides the ability to edit, save and reload Qlik Sense application scripts directly from Excel. This feature can be limited to administrators and certain report developers (power users) to maintain adequate security and consistency. 

Click the "Data Load Editor" Button to edit your script, make your desired changes.

Click the “Load data” button once to accept and save and changes to your App.

Clicking the "Load data" button once will also reload and recalulate all connected elements of your report.

Click the "Load Data" button a second time to execute script reload in the background. 

Notes: You will not see a reload dialog, but the updated results will be automatically reflected in your report after reloading. 

In order to use the "Data Load Editor" and the “Load Data” options, you need to be able to reload the application you wish to edit. The data included with the Qlik Sense example applications (e.g.Executive Dashboard) can't be reloaded and therefore can't be used for testing and understanding these features.
These buttons allow you, with proper credentials, to edit and execute the load script associated with your application. 

 ![Data load editor](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Data-load-editor.png)

### 6.4 “Table” 

 ![Table](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Table.png)

 ## 7. Using the Sense Excel Demo Report 

To enable the user of Sense Excel to understand, create and edit a report we have included an example. This file, ExecutiveDashboard.xlsx, is located in the Examples folder within the Sense Excel Reporting directory of your download package. It is built using the Executive Dashboard - Fileloop Demo example app that ships with Qlik Sense Desktop. If you do not have access to the app in your environment, it can also be found in the Examples directory of the Sense Excel Reporting section of your download package.  From there it can be copied to the %user\Documents\Qlik\Apps folder for use with Qlik Sense Desktop or uploaded into your Qlik Sense server via Apps section of the QMC.

To use the Sense Excel Executive Dashboard Report, please follow the following steps: 

1. Start Excel and make sure the Qlik Sense add-in is loaded and Toolbar is visible. 

2. Open the ExecutiveDashboard.xlsx file.

 ![Demo Report](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Demo-Report.PNG)

3. Connect to the Qlik Sense Desktop or Server via the "Log-in" button.

 Once opened, go to the Qlik Sense toolbar >> Log in >> click on “Open Hub” >> click on the “Executive Dashboard” app.

 ![Open Hub Dialogue](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Open-Hub-Dialogue.png)

Now that the Excel report is connected to the Qlik Sense app (.qvf-file) any changes made to the data in app in Qlik Sense will be automatically reflected in the corresponding data in your Excel report. 

4. Use the Global Selector, choose some filters and see how it automatically updates the figures in the Excel report in the background. Close the Global Selector by clicking above the black background. 

 ![Selection Tool Activate](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Selection-Tool-Activate.PNG)

5. View the filters that were just set in the Sense Filter Toolbar and click to edit or remove them. 

6. To see an example of Qlik syntax being used within and in conjunction with an Excel formula, click on any “ACTUAL” field within the Excel Demo report. There are four seperate functions being utilized in the formula in this example.  These are explained in further detail in Chapter 8. 

![Formula Only](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Formula-Only.png)

![Formula Expanded](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Formula-Expanded.PNG)

7. This report also features the existing Bookmarks included in the Executive Dashboard app definition. When applied, these will globally update all cell values in your report the same way as it would in Qlik Sense. New Bookmarks can also be named and saved based upon any other filter selections made by the user and reused later. 

 ![Bookmarks Dialogue](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel/blob/master/images/SE-Toolbar-Bookmarks-Dialogue.png)

## 8. Create Your Own Reports

 In this chapter we define two approaches to build a report in Excel using Dimensions, Measures, Formulas, Bookmarks and Filter settings directly from Qlik Sense. 

Approach 1 allows complete tables to be imported from Qlik Sense into your Excel workbork using the “Table” button and dynamically choosing the relevant columns. 

Approach 2 creates a function for each discreet cell within the Excel workbook and displays a value or string. There are a number of available functions that can be utilized in this scenario.

### 8.1 Using the “Table” import button 

Another way to get the data you need into Excel is through use of the “Table” button. The following steps will import tables directly into your worksheet and allow you to filter them using the Global Selector button either before or after your import to create the report that you need. 

Click on the “Table” button to open the “Sense” property panel on the right side your screen.  As you will notice, the behavior within this feature is almost identical to that of Qlik Sense.

Option 1 allows you to import the underlying data from any existing object within your Qlik Sense app.  In the example application. CY Sales vs. LY Sales is the available choice. Once an object is selected, the columns within it are displayed and you can perfom the following actions prior to importing the data into your Excel workbook:

#### 1. Reorder fields by clicking and dragging them up or down
#### 2. Remove any field by right mouse clicking and choosing Clear.
#### 3. Change number formatting by expanding the column information using the small triangle.
#### 4. Change sort order using the Sorting option and dragging the columns up and/or down into the desired sort order.  
#### 5. Once you have specified the desired behavior in the steps above, pressing the Check button will import the into a table in your adjacent Excel sheet. 

Option 2 allows you to choose your own columns using the Add Column button, identfying your column type by Dimension, Measure or Formula then scrolling or using the Search function to find and select your desired columns. 

Note: Master Items - Dimensions and Measures - defined in the Qlik Sense App cannot be used with the “Formula” function. Fields not idenfied as Master Elements in your data model, you can use the Formula selection and aggregating functions such as sum(), count() etc. on the fly to behave as if they were.

 When imported tables are too large (which is often the case), further filtering is necessary to reduce the amount of data returned to a manageable amount.  In this situation, the use of the Global Selector is advised. The Global Selector gives you access to all of the Dimensions and Fields in the app and their associated values and offers a search function to return relevant options for you to filter on. Upon clicking on any value using the Global Selector, it will be added to the “Current selections” toolbar as a filter. The Global Selector can be closed via a click above the dark grey area. Once closed, the filters persist in the Sense Filter Toolbar and, once there, additional selections can be made to adjust your result set(s). 

### 8.2 Fixed Cell Report Definition

In order to take full advantage of the power of Sense Excel, it is very useful to understand  Qlik Sense formula syntax and especially the Set Analysis features. This report creation strategy allows formulas to be entered into a specific cell on an Excel sheet and return a unique value to that cell. This feature is especially valuable when creating Financial reports similar to the example.  Once a single formula is created you can use the copy/paste and fill across/down features of Excel to rapidly expand the scope of your report. 

### 8.3 Sense Excel Formulas and Syntax

Upon installation of the Sense Excel add-in, several additional formulas are made available for report development within the Excel formula library. These formulas, their usage and syntax are outlined below.  

#### 8.3.1 SenseConnected 

SenseConnected is the command with which the connection to Qlik Sense can be tested. Either it returns true (WAHR) or false (FALSCH) which indicates whether or not there is a live connection to Qlik Sense. The Syntax is as follows; =SenseConnected() 

#### 8.3.2 SenseFilter 

SenseFilter is a function that allows the use of two parameters. It can be used as a filter box and allows use of curtain wildcard characters such as " * ". The first parameter can be a fieldname (e.g. Year) in double quotation marks (“), then a semicolon (;), followed by the second parameter (e.g. 2013), which is the filter to be used (without quotation marks) The syntax is as follows: =SenseFilter("[Fiscal Year]"; 2013) 

This function is added to any empty cell within Excel and causes the imported tables and their associated field names to be filtered by a second parameter. The Cell with the Filter will state "Already Filtering". 

#### 8.3.3 SenseVariable 

The next Sense command is SenseVariable, which can use up to two parameters. The first parameter is the name of the variable available in Qlik Sense. The second parameter describes the content of the variable. The syntax is as follows: =SenseVariable(“A”, “Bee”) will place the content “Bee” in all places where variable “A” is implemented using the =SenseVariable() function. 

#### 8.3.4 SenseEV 

SenseEV stands for "Sense EValuate" and enables Excel to call any Qlik Sense function including set analysis within an Excel formula in a discreet cell.   To understand the syntax the following example of a set analysis combined with excel elements has been added. 

=SenseEV(" // This starts the connection to Qlik Sense and calculates… 

 Sum({< // …the Sum of [Sales Quantity]*[Sales Price] and… 

[Product Group Desc] = {'"&$E8&"'}, // …is limited to where [Product Group Desc] = the value from cell E8… 

 [Fiscal Quarter] = {'"&SUBSTITUTE (L$4;"Q";"")&"'} // …the "1" is parsed from the value "Q1" in the cell and is passed as a set parameter value for [Fiscal Quarter]. 

 >} // 

 [Sales Quantity]*[Sales Price]) //. 

 ") 

## 9. Seven Steps to Your First Report in Sense Excel 

### Step 1: Connect to Qlik Sense & select an App  

Create your connection, press the Sign In Button.  Once the "Hub" button is active (turns black), press it and select the app you would like to connect to.

### Step 2: Press the "Table" button 

From the Table Property panel on the right side of the screen:

Dropdown the "Choose Select Table Object to Import" box to choose an existing table defined in your Qlik Sense App

OR 

Dropdown "Add Column" to individually select your desired Dimensions, Measures or Formulas 

OR

Use the "Fast Add" button to select multiple objects from your data model

### Step 3: Press the Check button to create the table in your Excel workbook.

### Step 4. Edit Table Definition
You can add columns, change column display order, change your sort order or change your number formats returned prior to importing your table or afterward by right mouse clicking over the table would like to update and choosing "Edit Table". This will re-open the Table Property window and allow you to make any desired changes. You can also reopen the Table Property Panel by selecting a cell within your table and pressing the "Table" button again.

### Step 5: Open the Selections tool 
Press the Selection button and find the field and value your would like to filter on and select it.  Alternatively, use the Search function to limit your choices to those related to your search term.

### Step 6: Select a Bookmark 
Use the Bookmark button to use any of the existing bookmarks in your app or use "Create New" to create a new one based on the filters you have currently selected.

### Step 7: Create an Interactive Chart or Pivot table 
Once your table is created, you can use the Insert Chart or Insert Pivot table commands from the Insert tab of Excel and your first report is done.
