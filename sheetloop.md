These options can be configured under sheetloop in Sense Excel

* exportRootNode: true / false - default: true
* sheetName: = '@@ sheetname @@' & only (Continent) & '| '& only (region)

Notice: If the sheet name is greater than 30 characters, the rest is truncated because Excel supports only 30 characters.
